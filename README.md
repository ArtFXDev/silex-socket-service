Silex Socket Service is the Socket.IO websocket and http API that acts as a bridge between [dcc clients](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex_client) and [front-end apps](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-front).

## Introduction

In the Silex pipeline, the front-end application is not integrated directly in the DCC software like Maya or Houdini. Instead, [silex-front](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-front) is a web application running in Electron.

Since we need to communicate between the Python client and the interface, we use websockets. The server handles multiple dcc clients connections and forward messages back and forth to the interface.

Using Socket.IO is a good solution for this bidirectional communication.
